smb2-handler 53.1 (20.12.2022)

- First released version.


smb2-handler 53.2 (29.12.2022)

- Added USER and PASSWORD arguments.

- Disabled CTRL-C signal checking in libc and ISocket->WaitSelect().

- Merged latest fixes from the libsmb2 github repo:
  - Convert system time to little endian in NTLMSSP code.
  - Convert destination path directory separators in rename function.


smb2-handler 53.3 (8.1.2023)

- Added a workaround for smb2_rmdir() not returning an error when trying to
  delete a non-empty directory.

- Added support for READONLY switch.

- If the reported f_blocks is larger than INT32_MAX statfs() will reduce it
  and compensate by making the block size larger (that way at least programs
  that use the id_NumBlocks, id_NumBlocksUsed and id_BytesPerBlock fields to
  calculate used and free percentages will report reasonable results).


smb2-handler 53.4 (18.1.2023)

- Rewrote the readv() and writev() implementations according to:
  https://github.com/sahlberg/libsmb2/issues/242

- Merged latest changes from libsmb2:
  - Read share flags and use encryption if needed.
  - Fix ntlm_convert_password_hash on big endian.

- Added AmigaOS 3 and AROS ports (the AmigaOS 3 port is thanks to the work of
  Szilard Biro).
