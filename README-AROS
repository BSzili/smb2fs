smb2-handler is a filesystem for accessing files remotely using the SMB2/3
protocols. The protocol implementation is based on the currently latest git
version of libsmb2 (https://github.com/sahlberg/libsmb2).

Requirements:

- filesysbox.library 54.3 or newer.

Usage:

Create a DOSDriver with the contents:
Handler   = L:smb2-handler
StackSize = 65536
Priority  = 5
GlobVec   = -1
Startup   = "<args>"

Where <args> should follow the template:

URL/A,USER,PASSWORD,VOLUME,READONLY/S,NOPASSWORDREQ/S

URL is the address of the samba share in the format:
smb://[<domain;][<username>[:<password>]@]<host>[:<port>]/<share>/<path>

USER and PASSWORD arguments if used override the username and password (if
any) specified in the URL argument.

VOLUME is the AmigaDOS volume name (if not specified it defaults to
<server>-<share>).

READONLY sets the filesystem to read only mode.

NOPASSWORDREQ stops a password requester from being opened if no password is
specified.

To connect to the share myshare on server mypc using username "myuser" and
password "password123" use:

Startup = "smb://myuser:password123@mypc/myshare"

To connect to the same share using a guest account you can use:

Startup = "smb://mypc/myshare NOPASSWORDREQ"

If you want the handler to be started immediately on mount, rather than on the
first access, then make sure that ACTIVATE=1 is set in either in the icon
tooltypes or in the DOSDriver file itself.
